     <p>The goal of this project was to create a program that can run Chip8 games. It was written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering and features heavy use of bitwise operations to interpret the opcodes. I started the project by implementing all the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Virtual_machine_description" target="_blank">technical requirmenents</a> like the stack, memory and the registers.</p> 
        
     <p>OpenGL is only used to render a quad that has a texture containing all the graphical information of the chip8 and the window this will be rendered in. I also made use of some OpenGL window callbacks to allow drag and drop of a game and handling the input.</p>
        
     <p>To actually make the chip8 run a game, the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Opcode_table" target="_blank">opcodes</a> needed to be implemented. For starting the first few opcodes I used the Maze game because it only has a small, but important ,amount of opcodes. Once the Maze game ran perfectly I moved on test actual games that require the input and sound opcodes and implemented the needed opcodes.</p>
