      <p>You play as a paper airplane, flying through an infinite windtunnel. You can only control the rotation of the plane. Bumping into the terrain, or other obstacles, slows you down and makes you lose health. However, the player is aided by a set of pickups and windtunnels that give you back some speed.</p>
        
    <p>This was a group project created for school. The team consisted of 2 other programmers and 2 artists:</p>

     <ul>           
        <li><a class="link" href="http://www.kwintenvdb.com/" target="_blank">Kwinten Van den Berghe</a></li>
        <li><a class="link" href="http://www.philippemesotten.com/">Philippe Mesotten</a></li>
        <li><a class="link" href="">Cleon Mocika</a></li>
        <li><a class="link" href="">Rene Vandamme</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>On this project I was responsible for creating the framework we used in Monogame as well as making the levels generate smoothly and without any performance issues. When we were reaching the deadline of the project I focused on implementing more Enemies and Pickups and finally some post processing effects.</p>
