    <p>The Kinect Animator tool is a still a work in progress. The goal is to easily use a Kinect to create animations.</p>
        
    <p>The tool can be used to record yourself with a Kinect and save the recording to a file, then it is possible to import any rigged model that uses the Kinect rig, map the Kinect bones to the imported rig and convert the recording with a simple button press. After the recording is converted the model can be exported again to use in other game engines.</p>
    
    <p>Written in C# and using the MVVM pattern for WPF, the project features an Undo/Redo system using commands. I have also written a mesh importer library and use SharpDx for 3D Rendering.</p>
