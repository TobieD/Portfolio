    <p>This was part of my Space Explorer project. But I decided it would be helpful for other projects so I wanted to create a more general script for it. I made this using some c++ functions but it mainly relies on the blueprint system of Unreal engine 4.</p>
        
    <p>It works in 2 parts, the first is a generator script that converts a texture into tiles based on the color of the pixel, the texture in the video below is only 16x16. With a C++ function I go over all the pixels of the texture and if it is a white texture I generate the specified actor. The second part is the Tile blueprint that uses a construction script to easily allow the spawning of walls. I only have to set the type of wall I want to spawn in a corner(North, South, East or West) and the wall will appear. </p>
        
    <p> In the videos below I show how I use this script to quickly create the tiles used for a dungeon and then use the tiles to create the walls for my dungeon.</p>
