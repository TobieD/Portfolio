    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        
    <p>The player and a friend take control of 2 robots and will be given an exercise to do, when one player gets enough energy by doing the exercise correctly the players will enter a battle mode where they have to use the energy gathered to fight the other player. </p>

    <p>There are 2 moves, Attack and Block, once the energy of both players is depleted they will get a new exercise.This repeats until one player's robot has been defeated!</p>

    <p>This was a group project created for school. The team consisted of 2 other programmers and 2 artists:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>During the prototype phase I worked on implementing the kinect in Unity, luckily a wrapper was available. During the development I worked mainly on fleshing out the battle phase.</p>
