       <p>This game is currently being worked on. It is a minimalistic game that requires the player to remember a pattern and recreate it in the correct order. The pattern is shown for a small time at the beginning of each round.</p>

       <h2>Technical Details</h2>

       <p>The game is being developed in Unity. I wanted to have the art style as simple as possible by only making use of blocks and colors. It also makes heavy use of Coroutines to handle the animations and color transitions. To generate the pattern I simply use a data table of ints</p>
